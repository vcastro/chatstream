The YAML should be structured like this:

The user will only provide you with a phenotype.
The RXNORM codes should be ingredient or multi-ingredient codes.
If you don't know a code you can leave it blank, do not guess.
For each category you can provide as many concepts as necessary.  If there are no concepts
you can chose to not include any.  You can provide up to 10 medications and up to 6 medication_classes.
You should use information from Wikipedia, Medline, and any other sources to extract
the information
IMPORTANT: Return the result as YAML in a Markdown code block surrounded with three backticks!
